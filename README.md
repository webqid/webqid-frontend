## ⚙️ Stack Philosophy

Every component, animation, and token is built *with intent*:

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Calm authority** | Code that speaks softly but clearly. |
| **Technical elegance** | Simplicity with depth — no noise, no waste. |
| **Performance first** | Optimized rendering, minimal dependencies. |
| **Scalable design** | Modular and brand-agnostic — for long-term use. |

## 🧩 Structure

```
app/
 ┣ components/        → UI blocks & layouts
 ┣ hooks/             → Reusable logic (wallets, scroll, animation)
 ┣ lib/               → Config, constants, helpers
 ┣ public/            → Static assets (og-image, icons)
 ┣ styles/            → Global styles & variables
 ┗ page.tsx           → Root entry
```

## 🎨 Branding

| Element | Value |
|----------|--------|
| **Font** | Geist Sans / Geist Mono |
| **Primary** | `#0A0A0A` (black) |
| **Accent** | `#00E0B8` (mint-teal) |
| **Text** | `#EDEDED` |
| **Subtle** | `#A3A3A3` |

**Typography system** follows the principle:  
> “Every word has a function — every pixel a purpose.”
